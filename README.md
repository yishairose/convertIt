# ConvertIt

This simple conversion app is built using react and material ui components.

Building this app I familiarised myself with react router and fetching data from a 3rd party api using loader functions. I also used this small project as an opportunity to build a moder UI using mui components.
The navbar is a demo and was an opportunity to set up an app router using react router. I left the router in place for potential extra features that may be implemented in the future.
